# MusicSharer PWA app

This Progressive Web App accepts Spotify share links and transforms them to a Spotify Search page with the track in the search results.
Until Spotify allows sharing tracks without autoplaying them (while destroying the current playlist), this is a workaround.

In the future, this app should store the history of shared songs in Local Storage 
and generate share links to other streaming services to share with people who don't have Spotify.

# Build

To build the app, run `npm run install && npm run build`
